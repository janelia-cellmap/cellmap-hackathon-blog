Ryan Conrad ([@conradry](https://github.com/conradry)) from the [Narayan Volume EM Group](https://cmm.ccr.cancer.gov/volume-em/personnel/) shared a demo of his Napari plugin: [Empanada](https://github.com/volume-em/empanada-napari).

From their [site](https://volume-em.github.io/empanada):
>It’s a library developed to efficiently train and deploy deep learning models for the panoptic segmentation of large 2D and 3D EM images. We trained a general model called MitoNet to automatically segment mitochondrial instances, using empanada and a highly heterogeneous dataset of labeled mitochondria. MitoNet is currently available for use in napari with the empanada-napari plugin – though we’re open to supporting its use in other software platforms.

You can find beautiful documentation put toghether by Ryan about the plugin and library through there [landing page](https://volume-em.github.io/empanada).

More can also be read in their recent preprint up on bioRxiv: [Instance segmentation of mitochondria in electron microscopy images with a generalist deep learning model](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.17.484806v2.full).
